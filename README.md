Learning Outcomes:
API Integration: Gained hands-on experience in integrating third-party APIs into a React application.
Responsive Design: Implemented responsive design techniques to ensure the application works well on various screen sizes.
React Development: Enhanced skills in React, including component creation, state management, and lifecycle methods.
